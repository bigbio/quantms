Information on development and how to get involved
==================================================

Development happens exclusively and publicly on GitHub. The main repo is at bigbio/quantms with a fork at nf-core.
The pipeline is written according to nf-core standards with all its continuous testing and DSL2 syntax.
Contributions are always welcome by forking the main repo on your GitHub account, creating a branch with
a meaningful name and opening a PR when all the needed commits were made.
The PR will then undergo manual review and continuous integration on test data, so make sure the
test profiles pass on your local setup at least.
