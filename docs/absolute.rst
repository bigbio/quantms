Absolute expression using quantms
==================================

Absolute quantification values
(e.g., how many micromoles of a peptide is contained in a sample) are inherently more
complex to obtain. One reason is that different peptides have different physio-chemical
properties and ionization efficiency. To obtain absolute quantities isotope-labeled
standards of known concentrations can be added during sample processing. The
relative quantity of a peptide can be matched to the calibration curve of its isotopelabeled
version and converted into an absolute quantity.
