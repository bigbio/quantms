Consensus of multiple search engines (ConsensusID)
==================================================

When multiple search engines are used ```--search_engines msgf,comet``` the results for each RAW file is combined into one single identification file including the combination of both search engines. The `ConsensusID tool <https://abibuilder.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/TOPP_ConsensusID.html>`_ is used to combined the results from different search engines.
