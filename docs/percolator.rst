Percolator (SVM-based re-scoring)
================================

`Percolator <https://github.com/percolator/percolator>`_ rescores search engine results for improved identification rates.
It uses semi-supervised machine learning to discriminate correct from incorrect peptide-spectrum matches.

Different properties from the peptide identifications such as: retention time, number of missed-cleavages, peptide
identification score, are used to train a SVM model that separates more accurately the true positive identifications
from false positives.

quantms uses Percolator to improve identification results and to obtain error probabilities for peptide spectrum
matches. In order to build a good mode for discriminating correct and incorrect matches, the tool needs sufficient
correct peptide spectrum matches. In addition, quantms also supports three different re-rescoring strategies: individual run, merge by sample,
or merge by projects in follow parameter: `--rescoring_range`. Re-rescoring is proved to have less time consuming and comparable performance in individual run.

Percolator features used in quantms
---------------------------------------

- score recalibration
- calculation of (posterior) error probabilities for individual PSMs
- limited batch sizes

Troubleshooting
---------------------------

Score recalibration fails. This might be a result of setting the wrong search parameters resulting in too little
identifications. In those cases, percolator can be disable using the following command:
`--posterior_probabilities 'fit_distributions'`. Mixture modelling using the *IDPosteriorErrorProbability* tool is a
fallback for Percolator. It is more robust, works with less data but on average yields a lower number of identifications.
