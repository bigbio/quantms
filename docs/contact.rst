How and when to contact us where
================================

- For interactive help and a first assessment of the problem we recommend to get in touch with us on Slack: |Get help on Slack|
- For obvious bugs or missing features, you can directly check for duplicates on GitHub and open a new issue
  based on the corresponding template. Due to limited manpower we probably need to prioritize features,
  so voting for an existing feature request with a thumbs up increases its chances to be implemented by us.
  Of course, :doc:`contributions <dev>` are always welcome. |Report Issue|
- To discuss ideas without a clear way forward yet or to get questions answered in a more contained format than
  on just Slack threads, you can use the GitHub discussions forum |Get help on GitHub Forum|

.. hint:: Keep in mind, that we might need to redirect you to the maintainers of the underlying tools for certain
    features. If you are certain that the problem comes from a certain tool, contact the maintainers. If unsure,
    just use the guidelines here and we will redirect you.
