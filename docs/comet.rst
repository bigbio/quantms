Comet search engine
===================

`Comet <https://github.com/UWPR/Comet>`_ [ENG2012]_ is an **open source** tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) sequence database search
tool released under the Apache 2.0 license [ENG2015]_. Among some of the main features of the algorithm are: multithreading, speed and
memory allocation.

.. note:: In quantms, comet has proved to be faster compare with :doc:`msgf` while identifying less than **15%** PSMs. In addition, comet consume less memory than :doc:`msgf` in general, while consuming more CPU.

In quantms, PSMs are exported from the search engine into .idXML (read more :doc:`formats`) without filtering for the re-scoring (see :doc:`identification`) step with percolator. The pipeline stores these original file results in the result folder under `searchenginecomet`.
