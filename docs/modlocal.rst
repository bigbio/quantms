Modification localization
=========================

Mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics is widely used to identified and quantify post-translation modifications in complex biological samples. In a typical (MS) proteomics experiment , the resulted spectra are most commonly identified with sequence search engines such as Comet, and MS-GF+ (read more details: :doc:`identification`).

However, for each of these tools, expanding the number of potential mass modifications that must be considered expands the search space and can greatly increase computation time as well as reduce the identification sensitivity. Spectra may also be identified by spectral library searching, wherein new spectra are compared to a library of previously observed spectra. More recently, the search engine MSFragger5 demonstrated very fast wide mass tolerance searching that enables identification of spectra having a large mass error, potentially indicating a PTM contained within a peptide.
