Quantitative mass spectrometry data analysis
==================================

Bottom-up proteomics is a common method to identify proteins and characterize their amino acid sequences and post-translational modifications by proteolytic digestion of proteins prior to analysis by mass spectrometry. In bottom-up proteomics, the protein extract is enzymatically digested, followed by one or more dimensions of separation of the peptides by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, a technique known as shotgun proteomics [1]. By comparing the masses of the proteolytic peptides or their tandem mass spectra with those predicted from a sequence database, peptides can be identified and multiple peptide identifications assembled into a protein identification.

quantms workflow in a nutshell
--------------------------------

Mass spectrometry quantitative data analysis can be divided in three main steps:

- peptide/protein identification
   - :doc:`identification`
   - DIA Identification
- protein quantification
- downstream data analysis and quality control
