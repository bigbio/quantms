Label-free quantification (LFQ) with DDA
========================================

Label-free quantification algorithms detect and integrate chromatographic intensities of a peptide. 
Quantification across several MS runs is obtained by determining and *linking* of corresponding peptide signals, so-called
*features*, between runs. While label-free quantification scales to a large
number of experiments, it heavily relies on correct linking of corresponding peptides.
*Chromatographic retention time alignment* algorithms compensate for differences
in chromatographic elution and reduce mislinked peptides across maps.
